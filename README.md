Python library to interface Kostal Plenticore units

Allows full access to all registers as defined by the Kostal interface description.
The interface description has to be converted into a text file (registers.txt) manually.

This work was originally inspired by https://github.com/robertdiers/solar-monitor, and the Modbus conversion code was adapted very little.
